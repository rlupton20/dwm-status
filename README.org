#+TITLE: dwm-status

A custom C program which provides information on the time/date, remaining battery power, and temperatures (via =lm-sensors=) periodically to =stdout=. This is intended to be used with =dwm= to provide and informative, lightweight and basic status bar.

* Building

CMake is used for the builds. To build on a unix type system run

#+begin_src shell
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" path_to_CMakeLists.txt && make
#+end_src

* Usage with dwm

#+begin_src shell
status | xargs -I{} xsetroot -name "{}"
#+end_src

* Configuration

Configuration is inline with configuration of =dwm= - edit the source and rebuild. Most of the interesting configuration options can be found in =config.h=.
